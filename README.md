Analytical Skills and Tools:

- Data Sourcing and Preparation for Exploratory Data Analysis & Geospatial Analysis
- Supervised Machine Learning (Regression): preparing and split the data into training and test sets, and run linear regression to analyze model performance.
- Unsupervised Machine Learning (Clustering): preparing data for cluster analysis; elbow technique to find optimal cluster numbers; the k-means algorithm, and attach cluster results to the DataFrame while visualizing and calculating descriptive statistics with groupby().
- Time Series Analysis: sourcing relevant time-series data via an API, subset the data for historical insights, visualize the data and decompose its structure, conduct the Dickey-Fuller test for stationarity, and perform differencing to stationarize non-stationary data.
