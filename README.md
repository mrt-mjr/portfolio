### Mental Health Disorders - Global Correlations and Clusters in Depression Disorder

**Motivation, Objective and Scope:** In this analysis, we delve into the global landscape of depression rates, focusing on the varying prevalence across different countries. By visualizing these rates on a map, we aim to highlight the regions most affected by depression and uncover potential correlations with mental health treatment approaches. This exploration not only reveals the critical need for innovative interventions but also sets the stage for understanding how countries can learn from each other in addressing this pressing mental health challenge.

**Analytical Skills and Tools:**

- Data Sourcing and Preparation for Exploratory Data Analysis & Geospatial Analysis
- Supervised Machine Learning (Regression): preparing and split the data into training and test sets, and run linear regression to analyze model performance.
- Unsupervised Machine Learning (Clustering): preparing data for cluster analysis; elbow technique to find optimal cluster numbers; the k-means algorithm, and attach cluster results to the DataFrame while visualizing and calculating descriptive statistics with groupby().
- Time Series Analysis: sourcing relevant time-series data via an API, subset the data for historical insights, visualize the data and decompose its structure, conduct the Dickey-Fuller test for stationarity, and perform differencing to stationarize non-stationary data.
